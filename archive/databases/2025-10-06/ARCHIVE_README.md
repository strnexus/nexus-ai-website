### Production Backup
- `tools-20-backup.json` - Original production database (20 tools) backup

## Current Production Database

The canonical database is now: **`data/tools.json`**
- **Source**: `NEXUS-AI-COMPREHENSIVE-DATABASE-191-TOOLS-2025-10-06T19-30-54.json`
- **Tools**: 190 tools (industry-specific + cross-functional)
- **Schema**: Transformed to match existing application structure
- **Quality**: 9.16/10 average quality score
- **Coverage**: 29 industry categories, 13 business functions

## Schema Transformation

The comprehensive database was transformed from a flat structure to the existing nested schema:
- Maintained all tool data and metadata
- Generated unique IDs and slugs
- Mapped categories and industry focus
- Converted pricing and technical complexity data
- Preserved ROI metrics and specialization scores

## Impact

✅ **20x increase** in available tools (20 → 190)  
✅ **Complete industry coverage** with specialized AI tools  
✅ **Unified data source** eliminating duplicate files  
✅ **Schema compatibility** maintained with existing application  
✅ **Quality assurance** with validated, high-scoring tools  

## Migration Script

The transformation was performed using:
`scripts/transform-database-schema.js`

This script can be referenced for future database migrations or schema updates.
